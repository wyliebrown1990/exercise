This project is an attempt to help simplify some of the work I was doing in another project and focus on delivering these core technologies:
1. Flask front end app
2. Postgres backend database (local)
3. Opentelemetry SDK and API instrumentation for tracing and metrics
4. Opentelemetry Collector sending traces to Jaeger
